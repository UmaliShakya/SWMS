Sustainable water management requires maintaining the balance between the demand and supply, specifically addressing water demand in urban, agricultural, and natural systems. Having an insight on water supply forecasting and water consumption forecasting, will be useful to generate an optimal water distribution plan. Our team have proposed a platform that targets the sustainable water management concepts for domestic usage and paddy cultivation, with the following modules: forecasting water levels of reservoirs,forecasting water consumption patterns, and optimizing the water distribution. We have used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for forecast modules and Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize water distribution. In this project we are presenting our work on the two forecasting modules, GP modules. according to our results the prediction modules are giving correct results in a short time.
